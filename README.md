I am currently transitioning into Artificial Intelligence, specifically the application of machine learning in engineering. This is my humble corner of the Githubverse where I'm actively learning and experimenting with the power of data and algorithms :woman_technologist: .

Follow my journey as I learn to unlock the stories hidden within datasets using Python, SQL, Excel, Power BI, Tableau and to develop AI models capable of improving processes and products.
I'm taking my first steps into the world of machine learning. Stay tuned for future projects as i explore their potential, especially in the engineering domain! :construction_worker:

This profile is constantly evolving as I learn and grow. Check back often to see what new adventures I'm working on :rocket:.

I'm eager to collaborate and learn from others. Feel free to reach out if you have any projects I can contribute to or any useful advice to help me on my journey.</p><p align='left'> You can view my <a href='https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HkkKNlLlOdOiee-16gEHFlWUb98rfoKL/view?usp=drive_link' target=_blank><u>resume</u></a> and my <a href='https://github.com/PeaceUdoka?tab=repositories' target=_blank><u>projects</u>.</a></p>
